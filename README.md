Bar charts are a fundamental way to display data distribution, making it easy to compare different categories or ranges of a variable.
This project provides a simple yet flexible tool for creating bar charts using Python and popular data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

We use population data from the World Bank as an example dataset, which you can find here.

Create bar charts for categorical and continuous.
Customize colors, labels, and other chart elements.
Save charts as images or display them interactively.
Handle missing data gracefully.
